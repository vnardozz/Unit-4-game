# Unit-4-game
this is my crystal collector game 

the objective was to create a game that randomly assigned values to " crystals" that users could tally together to to try and match the computers randomly generated number.

deployed  JavaScript with jQuery library to tackel the following:

Dynamically created UI to streamline the repetitive nature of creating crystals

Dynamically assigned values for both computer and user through the use of math.random()
